          Alongside my expertise in web development using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Next.js, I have
          completed courses in Seerat and Alima studies, deepening my understanding of Islamic teachings.
          I enjoy combining creativity with purpose, aiming to bring value to both the tech world and the
          community. Whether I&apos;m building user-friendly websites or expanding my knowledge, I am driven by
          a desire to make meaningful contributions.
